# Introduction
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Hello there!
# My name is Yossef, and I created these files to explain Python
# starting from the very basics all the way to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
#
# These files are designed to help you learn Python in a practical
# and structured way. A lot of effort was put into preparing them,
# and I truly hope they make your learning journey easier.
#
# All of these files were created to help anyone who wants to start
# learning programming and Python from scratch.
#
# At the beginning, the content may feel simple — but as you go deeper
# into the files, you will find more powerful and valuable concepts.
#
# Please try to read this message completely, benefit from the files,
# and share them with your friends so more people can learn.
#
# Thank you for making it this far!
